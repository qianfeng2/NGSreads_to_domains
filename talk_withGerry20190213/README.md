Reads-to-domain:
20190213 a Skype talk with Gerry. Some notes are below:

This DNA file all_var_exon1_dna_domains.fasta comes from Michael Duffy. If we have more questions, check with him later. Gerry treats this file as all comes from Rask’s paper. The identifier meaning is “Domain type+domain order+ gene name”

When we translate these DNA sequences to proteins, choose the frame with smallest number of stop codons. Even though there are 163 unique domains, but Gerry send me 150 msgs, actually he collapse NTS domain. 

Alignment tool is [Clustal Omega](http://www.clustal.org/omega/) at the domain level

Gismo alignment tool is one potential alignment for longer var gene.
